                            From time to time the Pointube market research department, or our contractors and affiliates acting on
                            our behalf, may conduct online research in order to gather feedback about our Site and Services, our
                            affiliates and sponsors through email invitations, pop-up surveys, online focus groups, and social
                            networks. When participating in such feedback, we may ask you to submit Personal Information. This
                            Personal Information is used for research purposes, and is not used for sales solicitations. When a
                            survey is sponsored by an affiliate or other third party, aggregate information of the survey results is
                            reported to the sponsor. Personal Information collected through market research will be used only by
                            Pointube, our affiliates, our service providers and contractors, and successors and assigns, and will
                            not otherwise be given or sold to another third party without your consent or as otherwise permitted by
                            this Privacy Policy. We will not knowingly accept survey responses from or conduct interviews with any
                            person under the age of 18. In addition to collecting survey responses from our members, cookies may be
                            used to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have
                            cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some studies. Cookies may be used to connect
                            survey data with Pointube site usage characteristics. You will be notified when we would like to use
                            cookies in this way and your consent will be requested for these cookies.
